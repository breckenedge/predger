Predger
=======

A preact-based single-page app to track spending. All data is stored in
localStorage. Uses service workers on supported platforms (Chrome/Android) and a
manifest cache on iOS, so it works when you're offline.

Developed from the https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate project.

Getting Started
---------------

```sh
npm start
```
